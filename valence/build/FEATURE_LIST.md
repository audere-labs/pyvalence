# Agilent GCMS Data Checklist
## Agilent Devices
**What devices are we targeting**
For the current AgilentGcms class we are targeting all of Agilents GCMS devices. More specifically, any Agient GCMS which produces a .MS file (which I assume is GCMSs of them). 

Additionally, I belive their LC-MS (liquid chromotography-mass spectrometry) and their ICP-MS (insane clown posse-mass spectrometry) all will use .MS formats as they use the same aquitiion, Mass Hunter, and analysis, ChemStation, software for all three GCMS, LCMS and ICPMS techniques.

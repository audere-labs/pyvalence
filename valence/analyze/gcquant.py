	The method matches the species which have the smallest difference

		Args
		----
		lib : pandas.DataFrame
			A dataframe containing identified species and associated 
			retention time. The dataframe can be created from csv 
			files by using AgilentGcms class from the build module 
			within Valence. It can also be created manually but must 
			contain a 'library_id' and 'rt' column.
		area : pandas.DataFrame
			A dataframe containing peak area integrations and associated retention time. The dataframe can be created from csv files by using AgilentGcms class from the build module within Valence. It can also be created manually but must contain a 'area' and 'rt' column.
		threshold : float
			The threshold is an optional falue (default = 0.1) for which the difference	of two RTs, one from lib and one from area, must be below for the match to be accepted.
		metrics: boolean
			When metrics is true the area peak, rt and delta between the matched lib peak is returned in additional columns of the dataframe. This allows for easy verification that matching worked correctly.

		-------
		pandas.DataFrame
			Returned is a dataframe which has library IDs matched to an area based on the difference of the retention times.
